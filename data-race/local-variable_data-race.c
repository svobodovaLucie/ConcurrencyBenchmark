/*
This program creates two threads that both increment a local variable passed to the function increment_local_variable. The problem with this program is that both threads access their local variable arguments concurrently without any synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread can access them at a time. This leads to a data race, where the value of the local variables can be incremented inconsistently due to the interleaving of the two threads' execution.

As a result, the final value of each local variable that is printed out may be less than the expected value of 1 million, since some of the increments may be lost due to the data race. To fix this, we need to use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or atomic operations to ensure that only one thread can access the local variables at a time.
